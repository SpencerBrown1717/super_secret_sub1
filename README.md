# Submarine Tracking System

A real-time submarine tracking system using reinforcement learning to predict vessel movements and Kubernetes for scalable deployment.

## 🎯 Mission Objectives

- Track 6 Chinese nuclear-powered submarines
- Monitor 1 Russian-supported Chinese submarine
- Predict future positions using reinforcement learning
- Visualize all submarine locations in real-time

## 🎯 Core System Components

### 1. Data Collection Layer
- Position Service for longitude/latitude tracking
- Telemetry Collector for depth/speed/direction
- Kafka event bus for real-time updates

### 2. Kubernetes Orchestration
- Single cluster with submarine-specific StatefulSets
- Custom Kubernetes Operator for management
- ConfigMaps for environment configuration

### 3. Storage & Processing
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial data
- InfluxDB for historical analysis
- Redis for real-time position caching

### 4. Visualization
- React dashboard with Mapbox GL
- WebSocket connections for live updates
- Real-time position tracking

### 5. RL Integration
- Data Collection API
- Model Training Service
- Policy Deployment Service

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

```yaml
# Example StatefulSet for submarine tracking
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: submarine-1
  namespace: submarine-fleet
spec:
  serviceName: "submarine"
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: submarine-simulator
        image: submarine-simulator:latest
        env:
        - name: SUBMARINE_ID
          value: "sub-001"
        - name: INITIAL_POSITION
          value: "{lat: 34.5, lng: -122.3, depth: 100}"
```

## 📋 Setup

```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Monitor tracking pods
kubectl get pods -n submarine-fleet
```

## ⚠️ Security

- All tracking data is encrypted in transit
- Kubernetes clusters are secured
- Access to tracking data is restricted
