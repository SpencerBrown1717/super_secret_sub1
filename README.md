# Project Neptune: Submarine Tracking System

A real-time submarine tracking system using reinforcement learning to predict vessel movements and Kubernetes for scalable deployment.

## 🎯 Core Functionality

- Track 7 high-priority submarines in real-time
- Predict future positions using reinforcement learning models
- Visualize submarine locations on an interactive map
- Scale tracking operations using Kubernetes

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Backend**: Python-based RL models running in Kubernetes pods
- **Frontend**: Real-time map visualization using Mapbox
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes cluster for deployment and scaling
- **Data Processing**: Real-time AIS and sensor data ingestion

## 📋 Setup

```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Monitor tracking pods
kubectl get pods -n submarine-tracker
```

## 🔍 System Architecture

## ⚠️ Security

- All tracking data is encrypted in transit
- Kubernetes clusters are secured
- Access to tracking data is restricted
